# Windows CLI Texteditor
This program is written in one single file and can be ran as a single executable.
It is a project I used to learn more about C programming, memory allocation and console manipulation.

I took heavy inspiration from:
https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/01.setup.html
which is a Linux CLI Texteditor. However, the syntax for C in Windows and Linux are vastly different when handling console manipulation, so I had to rewrite the codebase.
